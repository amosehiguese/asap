## How It Works

ASAP integrates with Google Gemini API as the LLM of choice for interacting, processing and analyzing user input, which can either be by text or a voice recording.This analysis is against a medical knowledge base, ensuring that it provides a high level of accuracy and efficiency in interpreting user symptoms.It uses a question generation paradigm to clarify ambiguous symptoms and to help narrow down the potential diagnosis.



## For whom ?

ASAP is designed to help individuals experiencing symptoms, who want to understand potential health issues before consulting a healthcare professional.
